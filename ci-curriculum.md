# CI Curriculum - Community Outreach Program

These are the essential skills that every participant attending the Community Outreach Program must be familiar with. 
We have built up this resource library by creating our own internal content and by curating our favorite blog posts, documentation sites and courses 
from around the Harness Ecosystem.

Here, you have access to resources which will help you understand the general concepts as well as the specifics of the Harness Architechture 
in depth.
